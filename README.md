# Composite_MQG


I present the reposity containing the X-Shooter z=2 compact Quiescent Galaxy composite spectrum. All the code to analyse the spectra and generate the plot are in the py directory. The data presented here are from ESO observations using the X-Shooter Echelle spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Atacama, Chile. The data used here (data/spec/*.fits) are from the ApJ published paper "X-shooter Spectroscopy and HST Imaging of 15 Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z > 2" and can be found here: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab5af4/pdf

Please feel free to use the software for inspiration. In case interrested in utilizing the data please do not hesitate to contact me so I can share the unbinned data.
The arXiv version of the paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01619.pdf
